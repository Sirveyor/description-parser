2. **Modify `parser3.py`** to call this module instead of the external application. You can do this by importing `CSVEditor` and calling it with the path to your CSV file:

```python
from csv_editor import CSVEditor

def display_csv_file(csv_file):
    editor = CSVEditor(csv_file)
    editor.run()

# Replace the external application call with:
display_csv_file("path_to_your_final_csv_file.csv")
```

3. **Test the Integration**: Run your application and ensure that the CSV editor opens, allows for edits, and saves changes correctly.

This approach will keep your Python application running until the user closes the `tkinter` window, at which point the application will terminate.
